    Cornell CoursePlan is a web application developed by me and 2 friends to aid
    Cornell students in their future course-planning. Development of the web application
    began at BigRed//Hacks Spring 2018, where it won Best Cornell Hack.
    Following the hackathon the project was revisited to add functionality before
    being released for public use. The site is available for use only to the Cornell community, and
    it allows students to create multiple plans for future courseloads and also keep
    track of the requirements they need to fill for their major and college. It is developed
    with HTML, CSS, Javascript, and PHP, and is supported by a MySql database that
    allows students to save their plan data to their account.
