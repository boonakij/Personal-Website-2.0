    cue (Cornell University Events) is an application developed by the Cornell Design & Tech
    Initiative "Events" subteam, which I am an Android developer for. The app is designed to help
    connect Cornell students with upcoming events on campus that they care about. This is facilitated
    by a Discover page, search feature, personalized recommendation feed, and bookmarking feature.
    This Android application was developed using Android Studio.
