    This Android app scans a dog in view of the phone's camera and determines
    its best guesses as to what the dog's breed is. When a dog is determined to
    be in the camera's view, a series of 10 "scans" are taken, where each scan
    results in the model returning the probability that the dog is of each breed.
    When the 10 scans are completed the scores are averaged and the user can view
    the top few guesses for the dog's breed. The app was made in Android Studio and
    uses a Tensorflow implementation of the Mobilenet model that was trained
    with the Stanford Dogs Dataset. It thus has the capacity to distinguish 120 dog breeds.
