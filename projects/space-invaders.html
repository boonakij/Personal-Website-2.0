    Space Invaders is a variation of the original, classic Space
    Invaders arcade game. It was made for an assignment in my CS 1110 class, so
    much of the game had already been given to us by the professor. The themes
    of the game are pretty similar with the original one it's based off of.
    Aliens move across the screen and then downwards, and the player ship
    must eradicate all aliens before they reach the bottom line,
    or before all lives are lost. However, variations upon the original
    include the addition of powerups, and a final boss: Professor Walker White, alienized!
