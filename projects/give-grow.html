    Give Grow is a web application I developed with 3 friends at BigRed//Hacks Fall 2018.
    We sought to complete a project that could be used for social good, and we also wanted to take a very
    design-focused approach. The product we developed allows users to designate a percentage
    of their weekly or annual income to put towards a donation fund and use that fund to "purchase"
    units of charity products/services. Examples include books for children in developing countries,
    natural disaster relief aid packages, and conservation funds. A unique feature of this application
    is that it allows users to visualize how much they can do with small amounts of money. I served as a
    front-end and back-end developer for this project, which we made using HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP, and SQL.
