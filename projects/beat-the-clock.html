    Beat the Clock is a 1-player PC game where the player controls a soccer ball
    using the arrow keys on the keyboard. The player must maneuver around the level
    and collect all the yellow cubes and score a goal before the clock runs out.
    This was just a small project I did to start learning game development
    with the Unity Game Engine.
