    Assassins is a game I'm currently developing with 5 teammates in my
    Analytics-Driven Game Design class. The game sees the player become
    an international assassin that must target and eliminate other international
    assassins in the scene. The player must be stealthy around guards and civilians,
    and must watch their back, since another international assassin is coming after them!
    This game is nearing release, and updates will be made soon!
