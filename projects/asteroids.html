    Asteroids is a 1-player space game where the player controls a spaceship that needs
    to fend off asteroids and incoming enemy ships. There are two modes of gameplay, "Play"
    and "Arcade." By collecting gold in game, the player is then able to upgrade ship
    attributes and acquire other ships. This app was made in Android studio, and
    was my first Android app.
