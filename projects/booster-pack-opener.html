    The Android app allows the user to simulate booster packs from some of the Pok√©mon Sun and
    Moon Expansion Packs (Sun and Moon, Sun and Moon-Guardians Rising, and Sun and Moon-Burning Shadows).
    When the user generates a new booster pack, all 10 cards are originally face down. The user can
    click on the card to generate a flip animation and reveal the card. The user can also progress both
    forward and backwards through the deck, to reveal new cards and review past cards that were already flipped.
    The simulated booster pack follows the same structure the identical booster pack would follow in real life,
    except that the 9th card of the pack is an Uncommon card instead of a Reverse Holofoil card. This change was
    made due to the absense of images of each Reverse Holofoil card online. This app was made in Android Studio.
