    This simple Android mobile game features everyone's favorite yellow Pok√©mon running
    and jumping over rolling boulders. The player's goal is to have Pikachu jump over as many
    boulders as possible before getting hit and ending the game. The only gameplay
    mechanic is that Pikachu jumps upon user clicking. The boulders are
    randomized in speed and size, but they will tend to get bigger and
    faster as the user gets further into their run. This project was developed in Android Studio.
