    The Trump Tweet Tracker presents a nifty dashboard with numerous sections designed to
    meet all of your Trump tweet tracking needs. These include recent tweets around your location,
    recent tweets around any location of your choice, and a collection of the most frequently used
    words in recent tweets both by Trump and tweets by anyone directed at Trump. There is a
    sentiment map of the United States that helps visualize how positively or negatively each
    state is tweeting about Trump. There is also a section displaying Trump's most recent tweets,
    the corresponding tweet sentiment score for Trump, and the corresponding America sentiment
    scores from recent replies to each Trump tweet. The Trump Tweet Tracker uses the Twitter API
    through Tweepy, and serves as a web application with a Python backend through the use of the
    Flask framework. TextBlob is used to calculate the sentiment scores.
